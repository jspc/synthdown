Synthdown is a notation for describing modular synthesiser patches; the README
at https://github.com/jspc/synthdown is the best place to learn how to write
patches in this notation.

From this command you can do anything, from validating patches all the way to
generating patching diagrams.

This command implements the reference implementation of the synthdown notation
and so if it works here, it ought to work anywhere <3`,
